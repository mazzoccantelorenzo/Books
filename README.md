## 📚 Reading Bio

I regularly **read two books in parallel**, alternating between technical and personal development. I read and apply, I don't focus on finishing the 356th page of the book, I'm not interested in that.
Every so often I jump into advanced texts out of curiosity and to broaden my perspective, like *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*.
