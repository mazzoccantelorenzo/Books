# What I'm Reading & Loving

I’m a big fan of professional self-care and personal development books, but my real passion lies in software-related reads—especially embedded systems and low-level programming.  
To keep things exciting, I usually juggle several books at once so my brain doesn’t get stuck on the same topic all the time.
